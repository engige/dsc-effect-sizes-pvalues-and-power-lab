For each sample size, simulate 100 experiments. For each of these experiments, generate 2 samples of the given sample size. Each sample should have a standard deviation of 1. The first sample should have a mean of 5 and the second should have a mean of 5 plus the effect size, you hope to detect. Calculate the corresponding p-values for a Welch's t-test for each of these sample pairs. Finally, use the p-values to calculate the power of the test. Remember that for all of the simulations where the effect size does not equal zero, the null hypothesis is not true. Store the overall power from the 100 simulations along with the corresponding sample size and effect size. Use varying effect sizes such as [0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2].
